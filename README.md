This project uses Power BI to analyze and visualize data related to electric vehicles (EVs), including trends in sales, charging infrastructure, vehicle performance, and environmental impact. The interactive dashboard provides insights into key metrics, helping businesses and policymakers make data-driven decisions in the growing EV market.
Key features include:
- Sales Analysis: Track sales trends by region, model, and time period to identify growth patterns.
- Charging Infrastructure: Visualize the distribution and usage of charging stations across different locations.
- Environmental Impact: Assess the carbon footprint reduction based on the number of EVs sold and their efficiency.
- Vehicle Performance Metrics: Analyze range, charging time, and energy consumption of different EV models.

Technologies Used:
- Power BI for creating interactive dashboards and reports.
- DAX for calculating key performance metrics and custom measures.
- Power Query for cleaning, transforming, and importing EV data.
